# HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📊 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations as it directly impacts productivity and cost.  
This project analyzes employee data to identify key factors responsible for attrition and builds a predictive model to classify employees who are likely to leave the organization.

The project focuses on **data analysis, visualization, and business insights**, with machine learning used as a supporting tool.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand employee attrition patterns
- Identify key drivers of attrition such as salary, age, department, and work-life balance
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build a predictive model to classify employee attrition
- Deliver actionable insights for HR decision-making

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**
  - Logistic Regression
- **Environment & Version Control**
  - VS Code
  - Git & GitHub

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset**
- Total Records: **1,470**
- Target Variable: **Attrition (Yes / No)**

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analyses performed:
- Attrition distribution across employees
- Attrition vs Monthly Income
- Attrition vs Age
- Department-wise attrition analysis
- Impact of Work-Life Balance on attrition

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Employees with **lower monthly income** show higher attrition rates
- **Younger employees** are more likely to leave the organization
- The **Sales department** experiences higher attrition compared to others
- **Poor work-life balance** strongly correlates with employee attrition
- Longer tenure and role stability reduce attrition probability

---

## 🤖 Model Building
- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Handling Class Imbalance:** Class weighting
- **Model Accuracy:** ~85%

The model helps identify employees at higher risk of attrition to support proactive HR strategies.
